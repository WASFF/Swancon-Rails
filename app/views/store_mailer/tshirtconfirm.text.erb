Dear <% if @detail != nil %><%= @detail.name_first%> <%= @detail.name_last %><% else %><%= @user.username %><% end %>,

	At Swancon you pre-ordered some shirts from us, we have them recorded as the following:

<% @shirtorders.includes(:user_order_merchandise_options).all.each do |uom| %>
		<%= uom.merchandise_type.name %> <% uom.options.all.each do |option| %><%= option.set.name %>: <%= option.name %> <% end %><br/>
<% end %>
