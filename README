Ticket Transfer
 - Need to have a final date... 
 - Admin list (need to see all transfer sets, and all pending - PRK needs to be able to cancel and confirm from this list)

User/Member Editing
 - Need to be able to add/edit membership details from new system.

Voided Sale
 - Email PRK that a Sale has been voided.

ALL THE EMAIL ADDRESSES SHOULD BE CONFIGURABLE IN THE CONFIG FILE!



Point Of Sale payment types - should have some sort of confirmation "You have processed this transaction?"

Fixes: Edit screens are all broken!

Twitter registrations need to change their email address, or we'll get bounces.
